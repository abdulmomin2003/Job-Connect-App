- Complete Project with required Libraries
## Requirements
The complete requirements of this project include:

- **Java version** 23.0.1-oracle
- **Libraries** 
  <br/>
  Included in the lib directory
  <br/>
  Must be configured in the build path of the project
- **SQL Server**
  <br/>
  Must be present in the host machine, also need to establish the connection with the SQL database
  <br/>
  If the Connection is not established, the App will still run on the machine, but won't be able to access the Database.
  - **Database Connection**
    The Database Connection is established based on the **DATABASE_URL, DATABASE_USERNAME and DATABASE_PASSWORD ** variables, to be created in the environment of the project.
- **API KEY**
  <br/>
  We have not provided the Api Key for the AI part of the project.
  <br/>
  However, if you want to use the AI features of this project, you will have to get the API Key from Gemini, create the environment variables API_KEY and API_URL, and add the Key and URL to those variables.
  <br/>The MCQ tests, and Courses recommended were generated by Gemini Api.
- **Local Machine**
  <br/>
  The codespace doesnot support the GUI display, so you can not run the project on GitHub Codespaces, so you will have to use <b/>Local Machine</b> for that.
