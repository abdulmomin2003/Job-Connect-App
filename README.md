  If the Connection is not established, the App will still run on the machine, but won't be able to access the Database. 
- **API KEY**
  <br/>
  We have not provided the Api Key for the AI part of the project.
  <br/>
  However, if you want to use the AI features of this project, you will have to get the API Key from Gemini, and add it to the Api Key part of the project in GeminiApiTest.java class.
  <br/>The MCQ tests, and Courses recommended were generated by Gemini Api.
- Local Machine
  <br/>
  The codespace doesnot support the GUI display, so you can not run the project on GitHub Codespaces, so you will have to use <b/>Local Machine</b> for that.
